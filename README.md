# 356-Days-Of-Data-Science
# ðŸ“Š Data Science Journey â€” 2025 ðŸš€

Welcome to my **Data Science Journey**!  
Iâ€™m documenting my progress day by day as I learn and build projects in Data Science, AI, and LLM applications.  
Follow along as I explore new tools, techniques, and ideas. ðŸŒŸ

## ðŸŒŸ Progress Log

### ðŸ“… **Day 1 of 365**  
**Topic:** *Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)*  

Today I explored **KDE (Kernel Density Estimation)** â€” a powerful method to understand the general trend of data, even when it appears noisy.  
I practiced on a *student performance dataset* and realized how smooth curves can reveal hidden patterns in the data. ðŸ“ˆ  
A fascinating tool for better data visualization and insights!

### ðŸ“… **Day 2 of 365**  
**Topic:** *LangChain â€” Building LLM Applications*  

Today I dove into **LangChain** â€” an amazing framework to build efficient **LLM-powered apps**.  
It helps speed up development cycles and makes chat-based features more dynamic and modular.  
Super impressed by how much it simplifies the process!  

âœ… Progress: *~38% through the course*  
âœ… Completed several lectures and hands-on practice.

### ðŸ“… **Day 3 of 100**  
**Milestones:**  

âœ… **Completed the LangChain course** on Hugging Face.  
âœ… **Started learning Matplotlib** on DataCamp.  

Currently brainstorming project ideas to put LangChain into action â€” excited to start building! ðŸš€
